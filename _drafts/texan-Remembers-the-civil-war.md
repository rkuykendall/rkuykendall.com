**Will on his place in history**

> I was “only a private,” a mere atom in that human projectile so often hurled at the enemy, and never having to my knowledge distinguished myself, my story can only be such as can be told by thousands of others who wore the grey.

**Will’s family on duty and honor.**

> My own mother when kissing me good bye whispered in my ear, “do your duty like a man,” and my old father when giving me the last hand clasp said with trembling lips “you know you are our only son and how we worship you, but your mother and myself would rather hear of your death at any time than to hear of your cowardice.”

Will on food & creative cooking.

> Rations of corn meal and bacon were issued to us, and as we had no cooking utensils, we baked our cornbread on the sides of flat fence rails turned up to the fire and our bacon was broiled on forked sticks, but we enjoyed this feast for we had been forty eight hours without food of any kind.

POW Will on Union captains.

> I at once suggested very shortly to him, and in the fewest possible words, that he emigrate to a country where the climate was much warmer than to be found in American.

Will on being a badass.

> Bowing our heads and grasping our guns firmly we plunged into that vortex of hell. On emerging from the fire and smoke yelling like demons, we dashed at the Federals and soon had them flying.
