Introduction

I have always been fascinated by illegal art. I think it is because of the contrast between the two words. When I hear “illegal” I think about destructive, selfish acts, but “art” is by definition creative and expressive. This magnifies any beautify I find in the piece. I think to myself, “This is beautiful, and I was never supposed to experience it.” I explored the stories behind these pieces, why they were banned, and how things were changing. These are the stories of three albums, told together to illustrate the changes in sampling and copyright over the past twenty-five years.


1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)

Walking below a bright blue sky on the first day of 1987, Bill Drummond decided he was going to make a Hip Hop album. Bill could play the guitar and piano, but didn’t know enough about editing technology to produce the album he wanted on his own. Then he remembered Jimmy Cauty, who he knew had similar tastes and backgrounds in music. When Jimmy heard Bill say “Let's form a band called The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu,” he knew exact what he was thinking. They recorded their first single within a week, and an album titled “1987 - What the Fuck Is Going On?” on their own record label later that year they. The album was widely available, despite containing numerous samples from television, radio, and artists that included Samantha Fox and the Sex Pistols [1, 23] [2, 59-60].

The seventh track of the record, titled “The Queen and I (99 BPM),” heavily sampled the song “Dancing Queen” by Swedish pop group ABBA. When news of this reached Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulraeus, two of the four members of ABBA, they strongly objected to its use [4 7]. The Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society ( MCPS ) notified the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (The JAMs) that ABBA would not willing to grant a licence for the infringing track, and demanded that the JAMs they cease all production, destroy all copies in circulation, and deliver the original masters, mothers, and stampers to the MCPS [2, 59-60] [4, 8 letter from MCPS to JAMs, Bill Drummond].

When Bill Drummond heard that ABBA disapproved, he sat down to write a defence of what they were doing artistically and creatively. Machines like samplers were being invented, thought Drummond, and once they were out there they couldn’t be stopped. He would just sit down with Benny and Bjorn, and have an artist to artist talk about the similarities between the ways they created music. “They were singing in English for a start, which was taking our language,” Drummond said in Justified and Ancient History: The Unfolding Story of the KLF, written and self published in 1993 by Pete Robinson when he was only 15 years old [5] [4, 7 Bill Drummond Quote]. “They were taking a form that was American popular music, and making it into something their own and selling it back to the world. I just thought that there was no difference in what they were doing, to what we were doing.”

After it became clear the ABBA’s local representation were not interested in talking about the artistic merit of 1987, Bill and Jimmy decided they would take their case directly to ABBA in Sweden [6]. They later found that one of the band members lived in England, but by then they had already bought the ferry ticket and figured the trip might help their case. “If it goes to court and it looks like we've done everything we can to put our side of the story,” Jimmy explained to Mat Smith of Melody Maker Magazine, “it'd look better for us” [6]. Over a thousand miles later, the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu found themselves standing in front of the offices of Polar Music in Stockholm presenting a fake gold album inscribed ‘For sales in excess of zero’ to a prostitute dressed as one of the women in ABBA [7].

At six the following morning, the Justified Ancients stood in an empty field, down a dirt track, off a country road, surrounded by forest, in Sweden. The sun was rising over the tops of the trees, and a huge plume of smoke was rising off the a flaming pile of records, and rolling down into the valley where it collected above a farmhouse [6]. “It was gorgeous,” Jimmy remembers, “The smoke was incredible. It was obvious that something really dodgy was going on.“ A local farmer agreed, and started shooting so Jimmy and Bill jumped into the car and sped away. Two minutes into their getaway, there was a huge explosion from under the hood. The car had must have taken a bullet, their engine had just blown up [6]. The Automobile Association towed them back to London, ending their trip, and with it all hope of redeeming 1987. Kembrew McLeod later wrote in a pager on Digital Sampling, that Cauty had “left open the question of why he thought record burnings and prostitutes dressed as ABBA would help their cause” [7].

The album was re-released as "1987 (The JAMs 45 Edits)" with all of the samples removed, replaced long periods of silence. The album contained instructions that they promised would allow the buyer to, “after some practice, be able to simulate the sound of our original record” [2, 59-60] [3, 5]. “To do this you will need three wind-up record decks, a pile of selected disks, one TV. Set [sic] and a video machine loaded with a cassette of edited highlights of last week’s Top of the Pops” [2] [3].

Martin Cloonan saw ABBA’s claim as an example of the ability of copyright to be used as a tool to obstruct freedom of expression, a form of censorship as defined in his article “Call that Censorship? Problems of Definition.” The article outlines three levels of censorship: prior restraint, restriction, and suppression [1]. All possible existing copies of 1987 were suppressed, the JAMs were restricted from continuing to produce the album, and the case led to an increased level of prior restraint that would cause other albums like it to never be produced [1].

Steve Greenfield and Guy Osborn cited 1987 in “Remote Control: Legal Censorship of the Creative Process” as an instance where copyright was used as a tool of censorship [2]. Regardless of the fact that the album incorporated existing works, the issue remained that a new work of creative expression was prevented from being released by another party [2]. Greenfield and Osborn attribute this to the extension of property rights onto creative works, which allow the owner of the original work to control its reuse. The goal of copyright law is to promote creative endeavor, but In the age of digital sampling, it is arguable that this view of ownership deters creativity [2] [8].



The Grey Album, 2004

In November of 2003, hip-hop artist Jay-Z released The Black Album. In addition to the final produced album, an “a cappella” version was released to encourage Disc Jockeys (“DJs”) to create remixes by laying Jay-Z’s unaccompanied vocals onto new beats and into new patterns [11]. These vocals found their way to Brian Burton, better known as DJ Danger Mouse. Burton had just produced "Ghetto Pop Life," considered one of the most innovative releases of 2003, with Jemini, a rapper from Brooklyn [10]. A week or two after receiving the vocal tracks, and with no plans on using them, Brian was cleaning house to the Beatles’ White Album when a simple idea struck him: The White Album + The Black Album = The Grey Album [10]. “Oh shit,” he thought “I can probably do this” [10]. Well aware of the impossibility licencing the samples, he told himself “Never will this come out” and thought carefully about the hours he was about to dedicate to a project that could never be widely distributed [10]. It didn’t matter, the call was too strong. “Must still do . . . must still do.” he told himself [10].

Burton would go on to spend the next two and a half weeks in his room, easily fifteen-hour days, piecing together The Grey Album [10]. He began by playing The White Album from beginning to end four times, listening to every detail of the music, and then began to “deconstruct” the album into bits and pieces that could be used [10] [11]. The next step was to listen to all the lyrics on the a cappella version of The Black Album and measure the number of beats per minute (BPM) in each track. It would have been fairly easy to match the lyrics to music of the same tempo, but Burton wanted the music to match the feel of the lyrics, too. For example, the opening track, “December 4th,” which features short speeches by Jay-Z’s mother was paired with the instrumentals from the soft and thoughtful “Mother Nature’s Son,” while “99 Problems” was matched to The Beatles’ loud and dirty “Helter Skelter” [10]. Burton molded the pitch and speed of the samples, some too small to recognise, to fit each track [10] [11]. Each track begins with a clear sample from the White Album track that formed the foundation of that mix, combined with samples from as many as twenty-five other White Album tracks to produce an song that would “sound like it was really part of the Beatles,” instead of simply “laid on top of it” [11]. More than two hundred hours later, Burton finished the album, sent a few copies off to friends, and flew East to spend the holidays with his family [10].

Burton returned home to find The Grey Album spreading like a wildfire. The album received rave reviews in publications such as The Rolling Stone and The Boston Globe, which called it an “ingenious hip hop album that sounds oddly ahead of its time” and the most “creatively captivating album of the year” [10]. Jeff Antebi, head of hip-hop label and management company Waxploitation which represents Danger Mouse, said that there was a level of hysteria surrounding the release, noting that “more people say they have heard it than can possibly have heard it” [10]. EMI Music, representing Capitol Records, and Sony/ATV Publishing, did not receive the album with as much acclaim as the public and press. EMI and Sony/ATV sent cease and desist letters claiming copyright infringement on the sound recordings and original compositions of the White Album, respectively [11]. Burton complied immediately, but The Grey Album was no longer in his control [11].

Music industry and intellectual property activists saw The Grey Album as an example of everything wrong with the American copyright system. One newly formed music activist group in particular, Downhill Battle (DB) saw the album as the perfect medium to communicate with the public. DB co–founder Rebecca Laurie called The Grey Album “a clear, simple, downloadable example of how the major record labels stifle creativity and try to manipulate the public’s access to music, and it’s the perfect way to explain to non–experts why the copyright system needs to be reformed” [9]. The group announced a day of digital civil disobedience for February 24th, 2004, dubbed Grey Tuesday [9]. Just six days away, DB sought to capitalize on the critical acclaim and controversy already surrounding the album, while pushing the conversation in a more political direction [9]

Protesters across the Internet organized to host free downloads of The Grey Album for twenty four hours in defiance of legal threats from EMI. A press release sent out by Downhill Battle stated that Grey Tuesday was “an act of civil disobedience against a copyright regime that routinely suppresses musical innovation” [9]. DB argued that copyright law was being used as a weapon, to ban a work of art with no interest in compensation [9].

More than 170 websites hosted The Grey Album that Tuesday, despite EMI and Sony/ATV sending a number of websites cease and desist letters, as well as sending one ISP a DMCA takedown notice. Over 400 others showed their support with gestures such as turning their site grey for the day [9] [11]. Many college and noncommercial radio stations played the album in its entirety on the air [11]. The phrase “Grey Album” was being searched for as often as “Britney Spears” or “Outkast” [9]. At the end of the day, an estimated 100,000 copies of the album had been downloaded. More importantly, Grey Tuesday was covered in several mainstream news outlets such as the BBC and the New York Times [9].



Feed The Animals, 2008

On first inspection, Greg Gillis might remind you a lot of Brian Burton. He works from a laptop, and dismantles records into samples, pulling from a library of thousands of tracks, old and new, obscure and mainstream [14]. Greg Gillis is better known by his stage name Girl Talk, under which he has released acclaimed albums, toured the world, and was featured in an “I’m a PC” ad for Microsoft [14]. What makes Girl Talk unique is that his recordings consist entirely of samples, often of known litigious “Top 40” artists, and his records are widely and commercially available [14].

In 2008, Girl Talk released Feed The Animals, an album built on over 300 samples. The music was cut, morphed and mixed from artists ranging from Ludacris to Metallica, Lil Wayne to Radiohead, and Outkast to Kenny Loggins [14] [15]. Despite this, Feed The Animals became one most acclaimed releases of 2008 [15]. The album was featured on the year end best music lists of Time Magazine, Rolling Stone, and Blender [14].

The most significant part of Feed The Animals is that Girl Talk has not been sued, despite been rightfully described as a “lawsuit waiting to happen” [12]. Many of the 300+ samples from Feed The Animals were taken from labels that have already shown their willingness to sue over copyright infringement [12]. A representative of the Guess Who has even stated that they would chase down the infringement [12]. However, Greg Gillis has still yet to be sued [12]. Girl Talk, and his label Illegal Art, believe that his album is a new and transformative work, which is does not compete with the original [12]. Because of this, they believe the work will be deemed non-inringing fair use if it is ever challenge in court [14]. Gillis has no interest in testing his theory, but apparently neither do the labels. Girl Talk has not been sued, because he might win. Lawyer Peter Friedman agrees that the argument for fair use is a strong one, and if the court ruled in his favor it would overturn precedent that the labels would rather keep around [12]. “I’d go after someone I am more likely to beat” writes Friedman, “Othewise, I’d lose all the leverage I have” [12].

Gillis realizes that the atmosphere behind sampling has changed. “I’ve always felt for those who came before me and had to deal with copyright issues in a different era,” Gillis told Wired Magazine [15]. “Not much has changed with the legislation, but I think the mass mentality has definitely shifted” [15]. Gillis sees his work as part of a movement of academics, lawyers, and kids to create a more open exchange of culture [13]. Kids who have grown up in a world with the personal computer and the Internet are no longer limited to passively consuming media [13].



Conclusion

The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu made music freely, and did not expect to have 1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?) shut down. Two men familiar with the music industry were baffled, and traveled a thousand miles to explain themselves. DJ Danger Mouse knew The Grey Album would never be distributed, but he felt the need to create it in spite of its fate. The album spread like a wildfire on the Internet, to reach thousands of listeners on Grey Tuesday. Finally, Girl Talk has released Feed The Animals to critical acclaim and commercial success, without using a single original recording in his compositions. It looks like the industry has yet to sue, because they are afraid he might win. I can see the changes in copyright and sampling through these three albums, through the past and hopefully into the future.



“You can't kill the instinct the technology produces. We can only criminalize it. We can't stop our kids from using it. We can only drive it underground. We can't make our kids passive again. We can only make them, quote, "pirates." And is that good? We live in this weird time. This kind of age of prohibitions, where in many areas of our life, we live life constantly against the law. Ordinary people live life against the law, and that's what I -- we are doing to our kids. They live life knowing they live it against the law. That realization is extraordinarily corrosive, extraordinarily corrupting. And in a democracy, we ought to be able to do better.”

-Laurence Lessig, 2007
