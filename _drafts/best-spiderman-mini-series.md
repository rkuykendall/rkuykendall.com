Edit: If you're interested in more small, self-contained stories, I recommend these:

- [Spider-Man: Blue](http://amzn.to/1LZ96bw) - Peter's love letter to Gwen Stacy. Great if you want a modern take on a more classic era of Spidey. Also brilliantly written.
- [Spider-Man & the X-Men](http://amzn.to/1LZ9cjo)- Spidey as a guest-teacher at the X-School. Great if you want a light, hilarious Spidey book. Also brilliantly written.
- [Inhuman Error](http://amzn.to/1QNi0rt) - Great if you want to see Spidey interacting with the Inhumans and Falcap, and being very funny.
