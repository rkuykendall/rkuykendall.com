**Where should I start?** There have been over 50 years of Spider-Man comics mostly across two universes, Ultimate and 616.

**Universes?!** So Marvel comics started a long time ago, and their characters were in the same world, so they could meet each other and team up and stuff. In the year 2000, someone had the idea to create a new world, where everything could start from the very beginning again, called the Ultimate Universe. So the original world, which is officially called Universe-616, still continued, but this other world another one called Ultimate ( or Universe-1610 ) also developed for 15 years and a lot of really great series came out of it. Everything that doesn't have 'Ultimate' the title is probably the original (616) world, and Amazing Spider-Man is the main Universe-616 Spider-Man title.

**So which one should I read?** That mostly depends on how much you want to start from the very beginning. It's much easier to start from the beginning of the Ultimate universe and read it all the way to the present, since it started 15 years ago and not 50. For Ultimate, the starting point is easy: [Ultimate Spider-Man #1 [MU]](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/4372/ultimate_spider-man_2000_1).

**Well, ultimate-shmultimate, I want to read original, 616 Spider-Man!** That's cool too! But now you have to choose where to start. Here's all of the best starting points in the series, with a little information about each, and Marvel Unlimited links:

- **Amazing Spider-Man (1963) #1** [[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/6482/amazing_spider-man_1963_1)] - The very beginning! A good place to start if you enjoy it, but a bad place to start if you find it boring. It's really personal taste. Maybe try a few issues, then skip ahead unless you're really hooked?

- **Amazing Spider-Man (1999) #1** [[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/37894/amazing_spider-man_1999_1)] - After issue #441 they restarted the numbering of the series to show new readers it was a good starting point, but at issue #500 they went back to the original numbering, so people often just call this issue #442. It's a great way to jump to "modern" Spider-Man. It leads right into the "JMS run" of Amazing Spider-Man. A run is a part of a series written by a specific writer, with JMS being a writer people really like.

- **Civil War** [[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/discover/114/civil-war-the-complete-event)] - A massive comic event which had a huge impact on Spider-Man, and the Marvel universe. Plus, the movie very loosely based on it will be released next year. This is a cool place to start reading comics because you get exposed to so many characters! And for Spider-Man, it leads right into...

- **Amazing Spider-Man (1999) #546: Brand New Day** [[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/17338/amazing_spider-man_1999_546)] - A brand new Peter Parker emerges from Civil War! But why is everything different? This is a great fresh start for new readers.

- **Amazing Spider-Man (1999) #648: Big Time** [[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/34135/amazing_spider-man_1999_648)] - Parker finally gets his shit together! Great place to start, since it's got some of the BEST recent Spidey stories and leads right into the...

- **Superior Spider-Man (2013)** - Starts after the end of Amazing Spider-Man with issues #698-700 [[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/40120/amazing_spider-man_1999_698)] and then Superior Spider-Man #1 [[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/46462/superior_spider-man_2013_1)]. If you're going to start here, you may want to read Amazing Spider-Man #600 [[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/24407/amazing_spider-man_1999_600)], and #682-687 [[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/40110/amazing_spider-man_1999_682)] for a little backstory. Superior Spider-Man is absolutely brilliant, and one of the most important and memorable stories in all of Spider-Man, but also very different from Amazing so maybe not where you want to get started.

- **Amazing Spider-Man (2014) #1** [[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/45798/amazing_spider-man_2014_1)] - Modern Spider-Man! This leads right into the Spider-Verse. This is pretty recent, so you will hit the limit on Marvel Unlimited fairly soon, but it's a good way to get caught up very quickly.
