title: Where to start reading Spider-Man comics

***Where should I start reading Spider-Man?*** There have been over 50 years of Spider-Man comics mostly across two universes, Ultimate and 616.

***Universes!?*** Marvel comics started a long time ago, and their characters were all set in the same world, so they could meet each other and team up and stuff. But in the year 2000, someone had the idea to create a new world, where everything could start from the very beginning again, called the Ultimate Universe. The Ultimate universe was denoted as Universe-1610, while the original was denoted Universe-616.

So the original Spider-Man comic which began in 1963, *Amazing Spider-Man*, continued in the 616 universe, but so did this new *Ultimate Spider-Man* comic in the 1610, or Ultimate universe. He exists in the same world as a lot of other comics under the Ultimate title like *Ultimate X-Men*.

In 2015, a comic books event called Secret Wars is set to destroy both of these worlds and create a new, single Marvel universe with characters from both.

**Here's all of the best starting points for reading Spider-Man, with a little information and Marvel Unlimited links for each:**

### Ultimate Universe (Universe-1610)

- **Ultimate Spider-Man (2000) #1** [[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/4372/ultimate_spider-man_2000_1)] - This is the first issue of the brand new Ultimate universe. It's a great starting point into both comic books and Spider-Man, since it is such a clean start. With a brand new universe, there's no back history.

- **Ultimate Comics Spider-Man (2011) #1** [[[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/38394/ultimate_comics_spider-man_2011_1)] - This is the moment where the Ultimate Comics universe really created it's lasting mark on the world, with the beginning of the all-new Ultimate Spider-Man.

### Marvel Universe (Universe-616)

- **Amazing Spider-Man (1963) #1** [[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/6482/amazing_spider-man_1963_1)] - The very beginning! A good place to start if you enjoy it, but a bad place to start if you find it boring. It's really personal taste. Maybe try a few issues, then skip ahead unless you're really hooked?

- **Amazing Spider-Man (1999) #1** [[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/37894/amazing_spider-man_1999_1)] - After issue #441 they restarted the numbering of the series to show new readers it was a good starting point, but at issue #500 they went back to the original numbering, so people often just call this issue #442. It's a great way to jump to "modern" Spider-Man. It leads right into the "JMS run" of Amazing Spider-Man. A run is a part of a series written by a specific writer, with JMS being a writer people really like.

- **Civil War** [[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/discover/114/civil-war-the-complete-event)] - A massive comic event which had a huge impact on Spider-Man, and the Marvel universe. Plus, the movie very loosely based on it will be released next year. This is a cool place to start reading comics because you get exposed to so many characters! And for Spider-Man, it leads right into...

- **Amazing Spider-Man (1999) #546: Brand New Day** [[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/17338/amazing_spider-man_1999_546)] - A brand new Peter Parker emerges from Civil War! But why is everything different? This is a great fresh start for new readers.

- **Amazing Spider-Man (1999) #648: Big Time** [[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/34135/amazing_spider-man_1999_648)] - Parker finally gets his shit together! Great place to start, since it's got some of the BEST recent Spidey stories and leads right into the...

- **Superior Spider-Man (2013)** - Starts after the end of Amazing Spider-Man with issues #698-700 [[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/40120/amazing_spider-man_1999_698)] and then Superior Spider-Man #1 [[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/46462/superior_spider-man_2013_1)]. If you're going to start here, you may want to read Amazing Spider-Man #600 [[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/24407/amazing_spider-man_1999_600)], and #682-687 [[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/40110/amazing_spider-man_1999_682)] for a little backstory. Superior Spider-Man is absolutely brilliant, and one of the most important and memorable stories in all of Spider-Man, but also very different from Amazing so maybe not where you want to get started.

- **Amazing Spider-Man (2014) #1** [[MU](http://marvel.com/comics/issue/45798/amazing_spider-man_2014_1)] - Modern Spider-Man! This leads right into the Spider-Verse. This is pretty recent, so you will hit the limit on Marvel Unlimited fairly soon, but it's a good way to get caught up very quickly.

## After Secret Wars

We don't know everything about what the new world of Marvel comics will look like after Secret Wars, but I'm betting each new series will make for a good jumping on point. If you're not worried about having a lot to read and just want to be totally current, I'd jump on here.

- **Amazing Spider-Man (2015) #1** - This series will feature Peter Parker, formerly Spider-Man from the 616 Universe after Secret Wars.

- **Spider-Man (2015) #1** - This series will feature Miles Morales, formerly Spider-Man from the 1610 Ultimate Universe after Secret Wars.
