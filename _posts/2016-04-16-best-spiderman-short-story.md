My article on [where to start reading Spider-Man comics](/articles/where-to-start-reading-spiderman/)
is for people trying to jump into **over fifty years** of continuous Spider-Man issues.
Which is awesome, but also kinda crazy. Some people just want simple, self-contained
Spider-Man stories. These are great for gifts and libraries because they're not just
the start of something, but a complete story.

**These are my favorite self-contained Spider-Man stories:**


## [Inhuman Error](http://amzn.to/1QNi0rt)

This series is shorter than a normal trade, but is really great if you want to
read a hilarious non-stop-jokes Spidey, and get introductions to the Inhumans,
who are playing a big role in the Marel TV shows and soon the movies, and
Sam Wilson, who is Falcon in the movies, as the new Captain America.

## [Spider-Man & the X-Men](http://amzn.to/1LZ9cjo)

This story has Spidey as a guest-teacher at the X-Men School, teaching a class
while secretly trying to find out if the school has a mole. It's a great mix of
funny situations and Spidey doing his best in way over his head.

## [Spider-Man: Blue](http://amzn.to/1LZ96bw)

Very different from the last two, this is Peter's love letter to Gwen Stacy.
Great if you want a modern take on a more classic era of Spidey. This book is the
best I've ever read at capturing the spirit of early Spider-Man comics in the modern age.
