<blockquote><strong>Hi new viewer.</strong> I know what you're wondering: <em>&ldquo;how does he keep his nostrils so clean?&rdquo;</em></blockquote>

<p>I was the new viewer, on July 6th, 2006, and so I sat and watched. The video ramped from a whisper to a shout and then ran at breakneck speeds through ugly myspace pages, ranting comment replies, science news, international politics, and ended with a chess move in a game against the audience. <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/archives/2006/07/070606.html">The video was 3 minutes, absolutely hilarious, and informative</a>. Then I found out there would be a new one the next day, and every weekday after that, for one full year. This was <strong>The Show, with Ze Frank</strong>, and it went on to inspire <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXBEI_WZNK4">many</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4jAHiTE7ko">more</a>. videos of that type and is considered the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCdrGgpEQs">birth of modern video blogging</a>.</p>

<p>Five years after that last episode of <strong>The Show</strong>, Ze began again, with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYlCVwxoL_g">an invocation for beginnings</a>. What Ze is doing now is amazing, but it's just not for me. However, I come back to that invocation time and time again for inspiration and motivation.</p>

<p><strong><em>Here is the full text of Ze Frank's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYlCVwxoL_g">Invocation for Beginnings</a>:</em></strong></p>

<section>
  <ol id="bigtext">
  <li class="light">Don't call it a comb-back; I'll have hair for years.</li>

  <li class="huge scared">I’m scared.</li>
  <li>I’m scared that my abilities are gone.</li>
  <li>I’m scared that I’m going to fuck this up.</li>
  <li class="most break">And I’m scared of you.</li>

  <li class="start more">I don’t want to start, <em>but I will.</em></li>
  <li class="start most">This is an invocation for anyone who hasn’t begun,</li>
  <li class="start break">who’s stuck in a terrible place between zero and one.</li>

  <li>Let me realize that my past failures at follow-through</li>
  <li class="more">are no indication of my future performance.</li>
  <li class="break fires">They’re just healthy little fires that are going to warm up my ass.</li>

  <li class="more">If my <abbr title="Fuck it, let's do it.">FILDI</abbr> is strong,</li>
  <li>let me keep him in a velvet box until I really, really need him.</li>
  <li class="more">If my <abbr title="Fuck it, let's do it.">FILDI</abbr> is weak,</li>
  <li class="break">let me feed him oranges and not let him gorge himself on ego and arrogance.</li>

  <li class="facebook">Let me not hit up my Facebook like it’s a crack pipe</li>
  <li class="break huge facebook">Keep the browser closed.</li>

  <li>If I catch myself wearing a too-too (<em>too fat, too late, too old</em>)</li>
  <li class="break">let me shake it off like a donkey would shake off something <em>it</em> doesn’t like.</li>

  <li class="light">And when I get that feeling in my stomach</li>
  <li class="light">you know the feeling when all of a sudden you get a ball of energy</li>
  <li class="light">and it shoots down into your legs and up into your arms</li>
  <li class="light">and tells you to get up and stand up and go to the refrigerator</li>
  <li class="cheese sharp">and get a cheese sandwich,</li>
  <li class="cheese most">that’s my cheese monster talking.</li>
  <li class="light">And my cheese monster will never be satisfied by cheddar,</li>
  <li class="cheese break more">only the cheese of accomplishment.</li>

  <li>Let me think about the people who I care about the most,</li>
  <li>and how when they fail or disappoint me…</li>
  <li class="most love">I still love them, </li>
  <li class="love">I still give them chances, </li>
  <li class="love">and I still see the best in them.</li>
  <li class="break most">Let me extend that generosity to myself.</li>

  <li>Let me find and use metaphors to help me understand the world around me</li>
  <li class="break most">and give me the strength to get rid of them when it’s apparent they no longer work.</li>

  <li>Let me thank the parts of me that I don’t understand</li>
  <li>or are outside of my rational control like my creativity and my courage.</li>
  <li>And let me remember that my courage is a wild dog.</li>
  <li class="break">It won’t just come when I call it, I have to chase it down and hold on as tight as I can.</li>

  <li class="huge facebook">Let me not be so vain</li>
  <li class="break facebook">to think that I’m the sole author of my victories and a victim of my defeats.</li>

  <li>Let me remember that the unintended meaning that people project</li>
  <li class="break">onto what I do is neither my fault or something I can take credit for.</li>

  <li class="more">Perfectionism may look good in his shiny shoes</li>
  <li class="break">but he’s a little bit of an asshole and no one invites him to their pool parties.</li>

  <li class="love">Let me remember that the impact of criticism is often not the intent of the critic,</li>
  <li class="more fires">but when the intent is <em>evil</em>, that’s what the block button’s for.</li>
  <li class="break">And when I eat my critique, let me be able to separate out the good advice from the bitter herbs.</li>

  <li class="merge-down">There are few people who won’t be disarmed by a genuine smile.</li>
  <li class="break">A big impact on a few can be worth more than a small impact.</li>

  <li class="facebook">Let me not think of my work only as a stepping stone to something else,</li>
  <li class="break most facebook">and if it is, let me become fascinated with the shape of the stone.</li>

  <li>Let me take the idea that has gotten me this far and put it to bed.</li>
  <li class="break">What I am about to do will not be that, but it will be something.</li>

  <li class="start">There is no need to sharpen my pencils anymore.</li>
  <li class="sharp start">My pencils are <em>sharp enough</em>.</li>
  <li class="start">Even the dull ones will make a mark. Warts and all.</li>
  <li class="break huge start">Let’s start this shit up.</li>

  <li class="light">And god let me enjoy this. Life isn’t just a sequence of waiting for things to be done.</li>
