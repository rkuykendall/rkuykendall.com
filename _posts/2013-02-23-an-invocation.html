<blockquote><strong>Hi new viewer.</strong> I know what you're wondering: <em>&ldquo;how does he keep his nostrils so clean?&rdquo;</em></blockquote>

<p>
  I was the new viewer, on July 6th, 2006.
  The video ramped from a whisper to a shout and then ran at breakneck speeds through ugly myspace pages, ranting comment replies, science news, international politics, and ended with a chess move in a game against the audience.
  <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/archives/2006/07/070606.html">The video was 3 minutes, absolutely hilarious, and informative</a>.
  Then I found out there would be a new one the next day, and every weekday after that, for one full year.
  This was <strong>The Show, with Ze Frank</strong>, and it went on to inspire <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXBEI_WZNK4">many</a>.
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4jAHiTE7ko">more</a>. videos of that type and is considered the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCdrGgpEQs">birth of modern video blogging</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Five years after that last episode of <strong>The Show</strong>, Ze began again, with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYlCVwxoL_g">an invocation for beginnings</a>.
  What Ze is doing now is amazing, but it's just not for me. However, I come back to that invocation time and time again for inspiration and motivation.

<section>
  <div id="invocation">
  <p id="p1">
  <span class="light">Don't call it a comb-back; I'll have hair for years.</span>
  <span class="scared">I’m scared.</span>
  </p>

  <p id="p2">
  <span>I’m scared that my abilities are gone.</span>
  <span>I’m scared that I’m going to fuck this up.</span>
  <span class="most break">And I’m scared of you.</span>
  </p>

  <p id="p3">
  <span class="more">I don’t want to start, <em>but I will.</em></span>
  <span class="most">This is an invocation for anyone who hasn’t begun,</span>
  <span>who’s stuck in a terrible place between zero and one.</span>
  </p>

  <p id="p4">
  <span>Let me realize that my past failures at follow-through</span>
  <span class="more">are no indication of my future performance.</span>
  <span>They’re just healthy little fires that are going to warm up my ass.</span>
  </p>

  <p id="p5">
  <span class="more">If my <abbr title="Fuck it, let's do it.">FILDI</abbr> is strong,</span>
  <span>let me keep him in a velvet box until I really, really need him.</span>
  <span class="more">If my <abbr title="Fuck it, let's do it.">FILDI</abbr> is weak,</span>
  <span>let me feed him oranges and not let him gorge himself on ego and arrogance.</span>
  </p>

  <p id="p6">
  <span>Let me not hit up my Facebook like it’s a crack pipe</span>
  <span class="huge">Keep the browser closed.</span>
  </p>

  <p id="p7">
  <span>If I catch myself wearing a too-too (<em>too fat, too late, too old</em>)</span>
  <span>let me shake it off like a donkey would shake off something <em>it</em> doesn’t like.</span>
  </p>

  <p id="p8">
  <span class="light">And when I get that feeling in my stomach</span>
  <span class="light">you know the feeling when all of a sudden you get a ball of energy</span>
  <span class="light">and it shoots down into your legs and up into your arms</span>
  <span class="light">and tells you to get up and stand up and go to the refrigerator</span>
  <span class="sharp">and get a cheese sandwich,</span>
  <span class="most">that’s my cheese monster talking.</span>
  <span class="light">And my cheese monster will never be satisfied by cheddar,</span>
  <span class="more">only the cheese of accomplishment.</span>
  </p>

  <p id="p9">
  <span>Let me think about the people who I care about the most, and how when they fail or disappoint me…</span>
  <br />
  <span class="most">I still love them, </span>
  <span>I still give them chances, </span>
  <span>and I still see the best in them.</span>
  <br />
  <span class="most">Let me extend that generosity to myself.</span>
  </p>

  <p id="p10">
  <span>Let me find and use metaphors to help me understand the world around me</span>
  <span class="most">and give me the strength to get rid of them when it’s apparent they no longer work.</span>
  </p>

  <p id="p11">
    <span>
      222 Let me thank the parts of me that I don’t understand
      or are outside of my rational control like my creativity and my courage.
      <br />
      <br />
      And let me remember that my courage is a wild dog.
      It won’t just come when I call it, I have to chase it down and hold on as tight as I can.
    </span>
  </p>

  <p id="p12">
    <span>
      <strong>Let me not be so vain</strong>
      to think that I’m the sole author of my victories
      and a victim of my defeats.
    </span>
  </p>

  <p id="p13">
  <span>Let me remember that the unintended meaning that people project</span>
  <span>onto what I do is neither my fault or something I can take credit for.</span>
  </p>

  <p id="p14">
  <span>Perfectionism may look good in his shiny shoes</span>
  <span>but he’s a little bit of an asshole and no one invites him to their pool parties.</span>
  </p>

  <p id="p15">
  <span>Let me remember that the impact of criticism is often not the intent of the critic,</span>
  <span class="more">but when the intent is <em>evil</em>, that’s what the block button’s for.</span>
  <span>And when I eat my critique, let me be able to separate out the good advice from the bitter herbs.</span>
  </p>

  <p id="p16">
  <span class="merge-down">There are few people who won’t be disarmed by a genuine smile.</span>
  <span>A big impact on a few can be worth more than a small impact.</span>
  </p>

  <p id="p17">
  <span>Let me not think of my work only as a stepping stone to something else,</span>
  <span class="most">and if it is, let me become fascinated with the shape of the stone.</span>
  </p>

  <p id="p18">
  <span>Let me take the idea that has gotten me this far and put it to bed.</span>
  <span>What I am about to do will not be that, but it will be something.</span>
  </p>

  <p id="p19">
  <span>There is no need to sharpen my pencils anymore.</span>
  <span class="sharp">My pencils are <em>sharp enough</em>.</span>
  <span>Even the dull ones will make a mark. Warts and all.</span>
  <span>Let’s start this shit up.</span>
  </p>

  <p id="p20">
  <span class="light">And god let me enjoy this. Life isn’t just a sequence of waiting for things to be done.</span>
