    <blockquote><strong>Hi new viewer.</strong> I know what you're wondering: <em>&ldquo;how does he keep his nostrils so clean?&rdquo;</em></blockquote>

    <p>I was the new viewer, on July 6th, 2006, and so I sat and watched. The video ramped from a whisper to a shout and then ran at breakneck speeds through ugly myspace pages, ranting comment replies, science news, international politics, and ended with a chess move in a game against the audience. <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/archives/2006/07/070606.html">The video was 3 minutes, absolutely hilarious, and informative</a>. Then I found out there would be a new one the next day, and every weekday after that, for one full year. This was <strong>The Show, with Ze Frank</strong>, and it went on to inspire <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXBEI_WZNK4">many</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4jAHiTE7ko">more</a>. videos of that type and is considered the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asCdrGgpEQs">birth of modern video blogging</a>.</p>

    <p>Five years after that last episode of <strong>The Show</strong>, Ze began again, with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYlCVwxoL_g">an invocation for beginnings</a>. What Ze is doing now is amazing, but it's just not for me. However, I come back to that invocation time and time again for inspiration and motivation.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Here is the full text of Ze Frank's <a href="">Invocation for Beginnings</a>:</em></strong></p>

    <section>

      <p><span class="box" style="color: #ddd">Don't call it a comb-back; I'll have hair for years.</span></p>

      <p><span class="box" style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 1em;">I’m scared.</span> <span class="box">I’m scared that my abilities are gone.</span> <span class="box">I’m scared that I’m going to fuck this up.</span> <span class="box">And I’m scared of you.</span></p>

      <p><span class="box" style="line-height: 0.3em">I don’t want to <span style="color: #C91C00;">start</span>, but I will.</span> <span class="box">This is an invocation for anyone who hasn’t begun,</span> <span class="box">who’s stuck in a terrible place between zero and one.</span></p>

      <p><span class="box">Let me realize that my past failures at follow-through are no indication of my future performance.</span> <span class="box">They’re just <span style="color: #880606">healthy</span> <span style="color: #D53D0C">little</span> <span style="color: #FF8207">fires</span> that are going to warm up my ass.</span></p>

      <div style="width: 680px;">
        <p style="width: 320px; float: left;"><span class="box" style="width: 340px; line-height: 70px">If my <abbr title="fuck it let’s do it">FILDI</abbr> is strong,</span> <span class="box" style="width: 340px;">let me keep him in a velvet box until I really, really need him.</span></p>

        <p style="width: 320px; float: right;"><span class="box" style="width: 340px; line-height: 70px">If my <abbr title="fuck it let’s do it">FILDI</abbr> is weak</span> <span class="box" style="width: 340px;">let me feed him oranges and not let him gorge himself on ego and arrogance.</span></p>
        <hr width="680px" style="height: 0px; border: none;">
      <div>

      <p><span class="box">Let me not hit up my <span style="color: white; background-color: #3B5998; display: inline-block; padding: 7px 6px; font-size: 0.8em;">Facebook</span> like it’s a crack pipe</span> <span class="box">Keep the browser closed.</span></p>

      <p><span class="box">If I catch myself wearing a too-too (too fat, too late, too old)</span> <span class="box">let me shake it off like a donkey would shake off something it doesn’t like.</span></p>

      <p><span class="box" style="line-height: 0.4em">And when I get that feeling in my stomach</span> <span class="box">you know the feeling when all of a sudden you get a ball of energy</span> <span class="box">and it shoots down into your legs and up into your arms</span> <span class="box">and tells you to get up and stand up and go to the refrigerator</span> <span class="box" style="line-height: 0.8em"><span style="color:#E8E479">and</span> <span style="color:#DEC54B">get</span> <span style="color:#EDEA8A">a</span> <span style="color:#CD9A2D">cheese</span> <span style="color:#E2CE5B">sandwich,</span></span> <span class="box" style="line-height: 0.3em">that’s my <span style="color: #FC320E">cheese monster</span> talking.</span> <span class="box">And my cheese monster will never be satisfied by cheddar,</span> <span class="box">only the <span style="color: #42D697;">cheese of accomplishment</span>.</span></p>

      <p><span class="box">Let me think about the people who I care about the most, and how when they fail or disappoint me&hellip;</span> <span class="box">I still love them, I still give them chances, and I still see the best in them.</span> <span class="box" style="border-bottom: 4px solid black; font-weight: bold;">Let me extend that generosity to myself.</span></p>

      <p><span class="box">Let me find and use metaphors to help me understand the world around me</span> <span class="box">and give me the strength to get rid of them when it’s apparent they no longer work.</span></p>

      <p><span class="box">Let me thank the parts of me that I don’t understand</span> <span class="box">or are outside of my rational control like my creativity and my courage.</span> <span class="box">And let me remember that my courage is a wild dog.</span> <span class="box">It won’t just come when I call it, I have to chase it down and hold on as tight as I can.</span></p>

      <p><span class="box" style="line-height: 0.2em; font-weight: bold;">Let me not be so vain</span> <span class="box">to think that I’m the sole author of my victories and a victim of my defeats.</span></p>


      <p><span class="box" style="font-weight: bold">Let me remember that the unintended meaning that people project</span> <span class="box">onto what I do is neither my fault or something I can take credit for.</span></p>

      <p><span class="box" style="line-height: 0.3em;">Perfectionism may look good in his shiny shoes</span> <span class="box">but he’s a little bit of an asshole and no one invites him to their pool parties.</span></p>

      <p><span class="box">Let me remember that the impact of criticism is often not the intent of the critic,</span> <span class="box">but when the intent is evil, that’s what the block button’s for.</span> <span class="box">And when I eat my critique, let me be able to separate out the good advice from the bitter herbs.</span></p>

      <p>
        <span class="box" style="line-height: 20px; margin-bottom: -30px; position: relative; right: 10px;">There are few people who won’t be disarmed by a genuine smile.</span>
        <span class="box" style="line-height: 20px; position: relative; left: 10px;">A big impact on a few can be worth more than a small impact</span>
      </p>

      <p><span class="box" style="line-height: 1em;">Let me not think of my work <span style="position: relative; top: 10px;">only as a stepping stone<span style="position: relative; top: 10px;">to something else,</span></span></span> <span class="box" style="line-height: 1em;">and if it is, <span style="position: relative; top: 10px; font-weight: bold">let me become fascinated <span style="position: relative; top: 10px;">with the shape of the stone.</span></span></span></p>

      <p><span class="box">Let me take the idea that has gotten me this far and put it to bed.</span> <span class="box">What I am about to do will not be that, but it will be something.</span></p>

      <p><span class="box">There is no need to sharpen my pencils anymore.</span> <span class="box" style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #F292A0">My</span><span style="color: #FFAC2C"> pencils are sharp enou</span><span style="color: #555">gh.</span></span> <span class="box">Even the dull ones will make a mark. Warts and all.</span> <span class="box" style="font-weight: 600; color: #C91C00;">Let’s start this shit up.</p>

      <p><span class="box" style="margin-top: 8em; color: #666;">And god let me enjoy this. Life isn’t just a sequence of waiting for things to be done.</span></p>
