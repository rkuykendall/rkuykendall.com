**Is there any reason to go in order of events or can I start around various character runs?**

Personally, just read the runs you hear are the best. Things will be a little out of order, but the stories themselves will be in order, and you're always going to be skipping or going back for something so it's easier to focus on good stories and not even really try for perfect chronology.

**How extensive and far reaching are the crossovers and their impact on the worlds (should I pause character runs to read a crossover)?**

Depends on the crossover, and if it involves that character. For example, for Spidey, I say just stop for original Secret Wars and Civil War. For Avengers there's way more events like House of M, Avengers vs X-Men, Secret Invasion.

**Crossovers that are really good or bad one I should avoid?**

Here's my off the cuff memories of each event:

* **1982** - Contest of Champions - *Crazy-boring, but first!*
* **1984** - Secret Wars - *Great! Important*
* **1984** - Secret Wars II - *Ridiculous but funny.*
* **1990** - Thanos Quest - *Brilliant*
* **1991** - The Infinity Gauntlet - *Fantastic*
* **1992** - Infinity War - *Alright*
* **1993** - Infinity Crusade - *Kinda interesting*
* **1999** - Contest of Champions II - *Improved but still not good*
* **2000** - Maximum Security - *Alright*
* **2002** - Infinity Abyss - *Alright*
* **2003** - The End - *Alright*
* **2006** - House of M - *Important and good*
* **2006** - Civil War - *Important*
* **2006** - Planet Hulk - *Kickass*
* **2007** - World War Hulk - *Kickass*
* **2008** - Secret Invasion - *Important!*
* **2010** - Siege - *Good*
* **2010** - Shadowland - *Okay*
* **2010** - Chaos War - *Good*
* **2011** - Fear Itself - *Not good*
* **2012** - Avengers vs. X-Men - *Important and good*
* **2013** - Infinity - *Awesome, but basically just a chapter of Hickman's Avengers / New Avengers, so read those. Especially since eventually they lead to the 2015 Secret Wars.*
* **2013** - Age of Ultron - *Not important, basically Terminator*
* **2013** - Original Sin - *Not great*
* **2014** - AXIS - *Not good, but a few interesting tie-ins like Iron Man, Carnage, and Hobgoblin.*
* **2015** - Secret Wars - *The best ever*
* **2016** - Civil War II - *???*
