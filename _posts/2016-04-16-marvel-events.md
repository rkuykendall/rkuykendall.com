**What is a comic event?**

You can think of events in comics a lot like the [Marvel Movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#Feature_films). The movies *Iron Man* 1-3 make a trilogy of Tony's story. The movies *Thor*, *Thor: Dark World*, and *Thor: Ragnarok* will make a trilogy of Thor's story. Both Tony and Thor were part of the movie *The Avengers*. You don't have to watch both of their movies to enjoy *The Avengers*, but you can.

'Comic Events' work the same way. The event *Civil War* has 7 issues under the title 'Civil War #1-7', but over 100 issues of other series that tie into it. If you read every single one of those other issues it's like seeing a story from a dozen perspectives. But you may not enjoy them all. The main series is essential to the event, but most "tie-in" comic issues aren't. Read the ones [people say are worth reading](/articles/comics-for-civil-war/), or the ones with your favorite characters, or none at all. The main series for the event, just like the Avengers movie, will always be written to be as self-contained as possible.

**Is there any reason to read different events in order, or can I just read an event when it comes up in a characters story?**

As long as you know what year something a series was published you should be find reading anything anytime. Things will be a little out of order, but the stories themselves will be in order, and you're always going to be skipping or going back for something so it's easier to focus on good stories and not even really try for perfect chronology.

**How extensive and far reaching are the events and their impact on the worlds (should I pause character's story to read an event)?**

This depends on the event, and if it involves that character. For example, for Spidey, I say just stop for original *Secret Wars* and *Civil War*. For Avengers there's way more events that are significant to their characters, like *House of M*, *Avengers vs X-Men*, and *Secret Invasion*.

**Are there crossovers that are really good, or any really bad ones I should avoid?**
