**So this movie is based on a comic?** Yes, Civil War was a 2006 Marvel comics 'event', which means there were a lot of comic book issues which are included under the Civil War name. An 'event' is  like the Avengers movie. You can watch it by itself, but there are also a TON of things you can watch which give it context, like the movies Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, or even the TV show Agents of Shield. You don't need to watch all of these, just like you don't need to read every issue in an event.

Civil War is actually one of the most important, and largest events in the history of  Marvel comics, with the [official list totaling at #98 issues](http://marvel.com/comics/discover/114/civil-war-the-complete-event), so it can be a bit overwhelming. Here's my recommendations on which parts you should read before the movie:

### Read the 7 core issues of '[Civil War](http://amzn.to/1pmqXPE)'

These seven issues, [Civil War #1-7](http://amzn.to/1pmqXPE), are the core of the event. If you just want to read a single story, this is what you need. You can read it by itself and it will make sense. This is the 'Avengers movie' of the whole event, to self-contained story which everything else below here serves. These issues were written by Mark Millar, a writer well known for many series including *[The Secret Service](http://amzn.to/1pmsmWz)*, *[Wanted](http://amzn.to/1QMOORu)*, and *[Kick-Ass](http://amzn.to/1RdFDNb)* which became the films *[Kingsman: The Secret Service](http://amzn.to/1QMOMc9)*, *[Wanted](http://amzn.to/1RdFFVi)*, and *[Kick-Ass](http://amzn.to/1MennvA)*.

### If you read one other thing, make it '[Road to Civil War](http://amzn.to/1RdE3uK)'

I highly recommend also reading the six issues included in [Road to Civil War](http://amzn.to/1RdE3uK), which lead into the main event. They give backstory and context. Plus, it starts with my personal favorite issue of the entire event, *New Avengers: Illuminati*. This also includes more backstory on the Peter Parker angle of Civil War, and his relationship with Tony Stark, so it looks like it will be a great story to read before the movie.

### If you want to flush out the main Civil War event, add the tie-ins from the most important characters.

*[Civil War: Captain America/Iron Man](http://amzn.to/1RdF0Dp)* takes place at the same time as the seven issues of Civil War. As the two titans of the story, they are considered the two most important tie-ins. Personally, as [a massive Spidey fan](/articles/where-to-start-reading-spiderman/), I like to add *[The Amazing Spider-Man: Civil War](http://amzn.to/1RdDWzr)*. Unlike *Road To*, these issues are read mixed-in with the main 7 from the event, but can also be read stand-alone if you want. Think of them like the first three *Iron Man* movies and the first two *Avengers* movies. They are meant to be seen in order, but they also work as their own story.

### Or add the fan-favorite series: Frontline

*[Civil War: Front Line, Book 1](http://amzn.to/1MemN14)* and *[Civil War: Front Line, Book 2](http://amzn.to/1QMOgLq)* tells the story of reporters Sally Floyd and Ben Ulrich. You might remember Ulrich from the Daredevil Netflix series. With the main Civil War storyline very short and full of action, many people felt the series lacked depth, and didn't always make sense. Frontline is hailed for providing character depth, cleaning of loose ends, and filling in the holes of the main Civil War stories, as well as being very well written.

### If you want even more, add any tie-ins that call to you.

The complete Civil War list includes **tons** of tie-in issues. Browse through them and add anything else you want. If you're feeling bold, read everything! It's a long journey, and some are less relevant to the story than others, but it's a lot of fun.
